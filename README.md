# Djikstra22C


Your menues are missing the add edge, remove edge, undo remove, 
display graph submenu (BFS, DFS or adjacency list), saving graph to a file 
and saving the solution to a file. And because you shouldn't have access to the graph data 
outside of the Graph classes, you should have an undo Stack inside of the Graph or Dijkstra subclass.
