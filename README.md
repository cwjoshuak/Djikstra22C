# Djikstra22C
How It Works
=======


Compile and run. Program demonstrates Dijkstra's Algorithm.

Test input files are "uc.txt" and "da.txt"
There are pictures which show respectively what uc and da maps/graphs should look like when drawn out.

> You can also load a map from SavedSolution
> Offers Breadth/Depth-first traversal display and Adjacency List display
